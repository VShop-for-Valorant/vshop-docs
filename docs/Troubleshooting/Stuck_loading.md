## "My app loads infinitely after I log in"

The app loads infinitely. Even after a waiting time of 2 minutes & few attempts.

## Check version
Please check that you have the newest update of the V-Shop app.

## Check your internet connection
You need an active internet connection. One reason for a long loading time could be bad signal or internet speed. Check your Internet connection. If possible, try another network.

## Delete app cache & storage 
If the problem remains, please remove all app content through your operating system.
On Android, [try this guide](https://www.techadvisor.com/article/739613/how-to-clear-app-cache-on-android.html). On iOS, it is mandatory to reinstall the app.
