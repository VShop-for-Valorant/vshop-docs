!!! danger "VShop Development Update"

    Effective immediately (June 2023), **VShop will no longer be available on the Google Play Store or Apple App Store**. This decision was made due to persistent legal threats from Riot Games and complaints about the app, including those filed with Apple and concerning the VShop website.

    For more information regarding this situation, please refer to [this site](https://docs.vshop.one/distribution-update). 
    The Discord server will continue to operate as usual.
