## Can I be banned if I use VShop?

Riot Games officially said in a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/playvalorant/status/1539728676815642624) that using unauthorized third party apps is bannable.

We have been informed about three cases on our Discord in the year 2023, where the users of VShop have been banned. We are unable to explain these cases. Riot Games falsely bans some accounts due to third party software. Even when the account holders don't even use apps like VShop.

We take these cases very seriously, but Riot Games does not give detailed information about why they were banned, so we can't say 100% that VShop is responsible.
