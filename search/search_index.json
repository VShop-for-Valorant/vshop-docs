This is a difficult decision to make, but Riot Games won't stop sending me emails and threatening me with legal action. Last week (June 2023) they sent a complaint to Apple and today I received a complaint about the website. I also talked to a guy who actually talked to a MARQVISION employee and was told that they don't plan to stop and will shut down apps in the future, so it's only a matter of time before the Google Play Store app will be shut down again, so I'm going to do it before they do.</p> <p>In addition, I've published the entire source code to GitHub. To be clear: the app will continue to work and I'll put the project into maintenance-only mode, which means I'll fix bugs and issues as best I can, but I won't necessarily add any new features. If you want to contribute, open a pull request and I will be more than happy to look at it and merge it. Downloads are now only available on GitHub for Android as an apk file.</p> <p>The Discord server will of course continue to exist and I will be as active as ever.</p> <p>Thanks for all the support, I really enjoyed making and updating VShop for this wonderful community \ud83d\udc96.
